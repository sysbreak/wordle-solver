the first guess you should do is ROATE, hardcoded, its cuz its scientifically proved n shit

guess 1 filtering system is very simple.
from guess 2 onwards it uses frequency scoring, very simple
Frequency Scoring Strategy — The Basics
Count letter frequencies in all remaining candidate words.

For each possible guess word:

Score it by summing the frequency of unique letters it contains.

Pick the guess with the highest score — it guesses letters that are most common in remaining words, maximizing chances to get hits.

then it loops till you get the guess, usually takes 4-5 tries and wordle has 6 tries so its quite good. 

very fucking fast btw
